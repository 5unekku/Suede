# Suede

Suede is a strongly typed imperative programming language that serves as a successor to C++, C, and Rust, focused on zero-cost abstractions, quality-of-life improvements, and pretty, easy to read syntax. It is designed to be as safe as Rust, powerful as C++, but more simplistic akin to C.

## Philosophy

Suede is fundamentally an imperative language, prioritizing a primarily procedural/functional approach to programming, preserving low-level control.

Suede aims to implement portions of various paradigms to allow for extremely powerful and versatile code. Such paradigms include:
- Procedural
- Object-based (separate from object-oriented)
- Functional
- Metaprogramming
- Concurrent

Core goals:
- C's capacity for low-level programming
- C++'s wide featureset
- Rust's aggressive compile-time error checking and safe memory management
- Pretty, modern syntax
